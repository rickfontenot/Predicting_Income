MSDS6372 Project 1 Summer 2021 
Team: Tricia Herrera, Michael Mazel, Cameron Stewart, Rick Fontenot

In this project we explore a UCI data set known as "Census Income" and build models to predict whether an individuals income exceeds $50K/yr based on variables available

Our commented code is broken up into separate rmd files for each section of the project:
1) EDA.Rmd : Exploratory data analysis including outputting clean, transformed and scaled data sets which feed into the following modeling files
2) 
3) 
4) 

A written summary of our project is included in the MSDS6372_Project2.pdf file
